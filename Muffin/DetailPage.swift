//VC for details pages, which will be different depending upon what opens it
//therefore there should be some function that takes in which item is being shown
//and outputs the right details, etc. based on it.
//used for product info and could probs be reused for the edit and Add popup windows.

class DetailPage: UIViewController {
    //for the view
    @IBOutlet weak var Name: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet weak var Pic: UIImageView!
    @IBOutlet weak var price: UILabel!

        price.text="$"+String(pastries[pastryindex].Price)
        Description.text=pastries[pastryindex].description
    }
    //in the collectionview, show all the items in [pastries].
    //do all the same stuff for the detail view that was done in the main for edit segue.
    
    
    //first thing first, make the button work to activate this.
